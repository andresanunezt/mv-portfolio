Prior to my time at multiverse I attended the Flatiron School bootcamp where I learned 
fullstack web developement. During this time I gained experience learining and 
applying Ruby,Ruby on Rails,Javascript and React.

The bootcamp consited of 4 phases that started with building out a backend, 
learning the associated technologies.

# Green Thumbs
Green Thumbs is a virtual garden single page application. Users can create gardens and add plants to each respective. This is all done through vanilla JavaScript. It was an exercise that helped me understand the concept of the DOM.
