During my time at Aura, I worked on the Frontend and the majority of my year has been focused on work relate to the Growth Team. The growth team's main role is to perform growth experiments, or tests to find solutions to a company's problems in a given part of the buyer's funnel. 


Because of the sensitive nature of Aura's codebases, I will avoid using any actual code and rely solely on explanations.

As part of this team, I deilvered value by completing hundreds of tickets on numerous aspects of the application. Though my initial tasks mainly related to existing bugs, the scope of my work soon expanded to also include developing and implementing features related to the adquisition of customers.
